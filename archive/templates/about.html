        <p class="card-text">The goal of the Hololive Idol Archive Project is to have a large collection of information regarding the Hololive members and their singing performaces. With this site you can search for specific Hololive members, stream titles, or even songs that they may have covered or that you know are part of a singing stream that they've done. Hopefully this presents an easier way to discover performances of your favourite member or members so that you don't have to go searching through YouTube videos and then checking the comments of the videos to know what songs were part of the stream. :-)</p>
